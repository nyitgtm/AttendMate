## Software Development Life Cycle Methologies
The team chose to use software models, concurrent and V models, paired with agile techniques, DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method), and Scrum for a project. Concurrent allows for rapid iteration and integration, allowing team collaboration and changes without hindering progress. V model allows transparency between clients and developers, enabling early testing, verification, and improved software quality. Scrum, an agile technique, is best for team collaboration projects like AttendMate, using sprints to break down projects into smaller parts. DSDM, which follows the MOSCOW rule, ensures compliance with client requirements and works well with project deadlines and time constraints. These models will help improve the quality of software and ensure client satisfaction.

## Mission Statement
Attendmate aims to enhance the educational experience at NYIT by providing a simple system for all users.
